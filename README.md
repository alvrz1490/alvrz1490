## Hi there my name is Angel 👋

I'm a System Administrator looking to level up my skills and venture into the SRE / DevOps side of things.

### I'm trying to focus on the following areas:
- Reliability & uptime engineering
- Monitoring, alerting, and observability
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
